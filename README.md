# Reproduction on study "Sentimental LIAR: Extended Corpus and Deep Learning Models for Fake Claim Classification"
This is a reproduction and replication study for the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01047 .

The reproduction process of this study consists of the following parts: (1) using the same code which is shared by Upadhayay&Behzadan(source: https://github.com/UNHSAILLab/SentimentalLIAR) to reproduce the reported result (minor changes were added in the script due to the update of used packages); (2) applying the LIAR dataset to the same model proposed by Upadhayay&Behzadan(2020) and compare the result with the result from step 1. For the sake of distinguishing the two main steps contained in this study, the term "reproduction" is used to refer to exactly reproducing the work from Upadhayay&Behzadan(2020); the term "replication" is adopted to refer to applying the original LIAR data set in fake news detection.

Results of part (1) is presented in the "Fake Claim Classification using BERT-base with CNN.ipynb" file, results of part (2) is presented in "Fake Claim Classification using BERT-base with CNN (max_length = 250).ipynb" and "LIAR_Fake Claim Classification using BERT-base with CNN.ipynb" files. 

The final report of the reproduction and replication works can be viewed in the pdf file in this

This is a project of the course "Reproducibility in Natural Language Processing" at the University of Tuebingen.
